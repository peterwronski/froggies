        <p>Didier and Dominque first met while completing their National Service in the French Navy (early 1980’s).
            Several years later, they both met again in Aberdeen ….could this be fate? <br/><br/>
            Both went on to successfully establish two of the most highly regarded restaurants on the Aberdeen “Foodie” map and beyond: The Silver Darling and Café Boheme.
            Following many years of running both businesses, they decided a change of pace was needed and the idea of “Froggies” was born. </p> <br/>
        <p>Didier and Dominique have both won the following awards: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>City Restaurant of the Year (Scotland)</li>
            <li>Top 10 Seafood Restaurant (Sunday Times)</li>
            <li>Grampian Restaurant of the Year</li>
            <li><i>...along with many others</i></li>
        </ul>
